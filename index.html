              I noticed all your paragraph tags were uppercased. Just wanted to
              point out a quick note to you :) ...

              While this won't affect how the browser renders your code, we typically
              follow a lowercase convention when writing our HTML tags.

              I've gone ahead and lowercased all the <p> tags.
          -->
        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
      </div>


      <!--
          Similar to my note about the <p> tags, this is just another note on
          convention and doesn't affect how your code is rendered to the browser :).

          Typically, when adding attributes to your HTML tags (ie. ids or classes),
          we don't add white space around the attribute name, equal sign, and the values.

          In short ...

          What your code looked like:
            <div class = "box hobbies">

          Best convention (without spaces):
            <div class="box hobbies">

          I've gone ahead and adjusted the spacing and indentation for the rest
          of your code. I haven't adjusted the the following tag to leave as an
          example of what you had from before :).
